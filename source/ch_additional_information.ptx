            <title>Student Expectations</title>
                <p>Students should devote a minimum of 2-3 hours of study time to the course for every fifty minutes of in-class time (8-12 hours per week).  It is especially recommended for a two-day per week course that students devote at least 1 hour of study time to the course each weeknight.  Additionally, students are expected to be actively reading the course text and attempting homework problems while each section is being covered (not after).  Lastly, any student with non-academic obligations (e.g. part-time employment) is strongly encouraged to pay close attention to their course standing throughout the semester, so as to not fall behind in their studies.</p>
                <p>This course will rely heavily on concepts introduced in Precalculus (exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric) and Calculus I and II. It is essential that students resolve any prerequisite course material concerns as soon as they arise. Given the small size of the class and the nature of the course content, students with any concerns are encouraged to seek help from the instructor early on in the semester.</p>

            <title>Academic Honesty</title>
            <p>All students should familiarize themselves with the University's policy regarding academic honesty, which can be found in the Undergraduate Catalog.  Listed below are the most common infractions of the University's policy for a mathematics course.
                <ul>
                    <li>Plagiarism: claiming as one’s own work the published or unpublished literal or paraphrased work of another, including AI generated content. It should be recognized that plagiarism is not only academically dishonest but also illegal.</li>
                    <li>Cheating on exams, tests, quizzes, assignments, and papers, including the giving or acceptance of these materials and other sources of information without the permission of the instructor(s).</li>
                    <li>Unauthorized collaboration with other individuals in the preparation of course assignments.</li>
                    <li>Unauthorized use of technology in the completion of course assignments.</li>

                </p>

            <title>Antiracism at FSU</title>
                <p> At Framingham State University, faculty, staff, and students work together to sustain a learning, working, and living community free from hate, discrimination, harassment, and intolerance. We recognize the damaging effects of systemic racism—including policies, structures, and historic practices—on the experience and success of communities of color. Coming from different backgrounds and different levels of privilege, we can all affirm and engage in antiracist work.</p>
                <p> Diversity of voices, and of minds, strengthens our ability to solve problems and to ask and answer questions about the world we share. As your instructor, I commit to upholding community values of inclusion, civility, accessibility, and mutual respect. I expect this class to commit to creating a community that affirms and welcomes all persons from diverse backgrounds and experiences, and supports the realization of everyone’s potential. </p>

            <title>Recording of Lectures</title>
                <p> This class will use video and audio recordings of faculty and students, both online and in person, to better support learning in a blended format.  By enrolling in the course, students are consenting to being recorded in this class and may only withdraw such consent by informing the course instructor in writing. As these recordings may contain intellectual property as well as confidential student information (ex. student names, likenesses), sharing or transferring recordings of such content by any method currently available or any method that may become available in the future is not allowed, and copies of such recordings should not be provided to others; uploaded, linked, embedded, or otherwise posted  via file-sharing, social media, or other sites or services which could enable anyone to view or hear them who is not currently enrolled in the course; or share them in any other way.  Access to video and audio recordings in this class is for personal educational use only and is available only to individuals currently enrolled in the class, unless faculty permission is expressly granted. Recording and/or sharing course materials, including video and audio files, without the written consent of the course instructor is a violation of University policies (ex. academic honesty) and will be reported to the College Dean for further action and/or discipline.</p>
